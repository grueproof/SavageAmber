# Amber Bestiary

## Pattern Ghosts

Pattern Ghosts are mysterious entities created by the Pattern itself. They can manifest as spectral doppelgangers of Amberites or other beings who have walked the Pattern. Pattern Ghosts are unpredictable and can be either hostile or benign, depending on the circumstances and their nature. They possess a deep connection to the Pattern, which grants them unique abilities and makes them formidable foes or powerful allies.

### Special Abilities:

* **Pattern Connection:** Pattern Ghosts have a deep connection to the Pattern, which grants them the ability to manipulate it in ways that are difficult for even Amberites to comprehend. This connection grants them the following powers: _arcane protection, armor, barrier, bolt, burst, detect arcana, dispel, entangle, environmental protection, invisibility, light, and teleport_. They have a base pool of 20 Power Points to use these powers.

* **Ethereal:** Pattern Ghosts exist in a state between the physical and the spiritual, which allows them to pass through solid objects and become immune to normal attacks. They can only be harmed by magical weapons, powers, or other entities with a connection to the Pattern or similar cosmic forces.

* **Spectral Mimicry:**
Pattern Ghosts can assume the appearance and abilities of the beings they are mimicking, though their power is somewhat diminished compared to the original. When mimicking an Amberite or another powerful being, they gain access to the skills, Edges, and Hindrances of the original, but at a -2 penalty to all relevant trait rolls. This ability allows them to be highly adaptable and unpredictable in combat and social situations.

* **Weakness (Disruption):** While Pattern Ghosts are immune to normal attacks, they are vulnerable to abilities or effects that disrupt or manipulate the Pattern itself. Attacks or powers that target the Pattern or its energies can harm or banish a Pattern Ghost, potentially forcing it to retreat or be destroyed.

* **Fickle Nature:** Pattern Ghosts are unpredictable and their motivations can be difficult to discern. They may change their behavior, objectives, or allegiances without warning or apparent reason. This makes them unreliable as allies, and even more dangerous as enemies.

### Tactics:

Pattern Ghosts are elusive and cunning, using their powers to confuse, mislead, or wear down their opponents. They may employ hit-and-run tactics, striking from unexpected angles before disappearing into the shadows. When facing a particularly powerful foe, a Pattern Ghost may adopt a more cautious approach, using its abilities to gather information or manipulate the environment in its favor before engaging in direct combat.

In social situations, a Pattern Ghost may use its Spectral Mimicry ability to infiltrate a group or gain access to information it would otherwise be unable to obtain. It may also use its powers to subtly influence the emotions or thoughts of others, bending them to its will or sowing discord among its enemies.

### Encounters:

Pattern Ghosts can be encountered in a variety of situations and locations, often appearing when least expected or when the Pattern itself is under threat. They may manifest as adversaries, testing the resolve and abilities of the characters, or as enigmatic guides or allies, offering cryptic advice or assistance in times of need. The true nature and objectives of a Pattern Ghost are always shrouded in mystery, and the characters must navigate their interactions with these beings with caution and cunning.

* **Weapon Form:** Frakir can be used as a weapon by its wielder, dealing Str+d4 damage when used to strike an opponent.

* **Telepathic Bond:** Frakir has a telepathic bond with its wielder, allowing it to communicate with them and follow their commands. This bond also allows Frakir to act as an extension of its wielder's senses, granting them a +2 bonus to Notice rolls when Frakir is actively searching for something.

* **Ethereal:** Frakir can become intangible, allowing it to pass through solid objects or avoid non-magical attacks. It can still be affected by magical attacks or powers.

### Tactics:

Frakir is a versatile and cunning ally, capable of adapting to various situations and challenges. It can act as a weapon or a tool, using its constriction ability to subdue or incapacitate enemies, or its ethereal form to scout ahead or retrieve objects. Frakir's danger sense allows it to alert its wielder to potential threats, making it a valuable companion in dangerous environments.
