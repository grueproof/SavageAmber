# Corwin's Pattern Adaptations

## Edges

### Corwin's Pattern Mastery
*Requirements: Novice, Arcane Background (Pattern Magic), Smarts d8+*

Corwin's unique connection to his own Pattern grants him enhanced mastery over Pattern Magic. When using Pattern Magic powers, Corwin gains a +2 bonus to his Smarts-based rolls.

### Regenerative Healing
*Requirements: Novice, Vigor d8+*

Due to his exposure to the Jewel of Judgment and his Pattern, Corwin has developed regenerative healing abilities. Corwin recovers from Wounds and Fatigue faster, removing one Wound per day (in addition to his normal healing) and recovering Fatigue at twice the normal rate.

## Hindrances

### Unstable Pattern (Major)

The powers granted by Corwin's Pattern are not as stable as those from the original Pattern of Amber. When Corwin uses his Pattern Magic, there's a chance that the effects might be unpredictable or unstable. The GM can introduce complications or unexpected side effects as they see fit.

## Powers

### Corwin's Pattern Imprint (Special)

Corwin's connection to his own Pattern grants him unique abilities that can be developed as Arcane Powers. These powers might include manipulating the fabric of reality, creating pocket dimensions, or altering probability in ways that are distinct from the standard Pattern Magic abilities. The exact nature of these powers would be up to the GM and player to determine, and they could be acquired through experience and character advancement.

## Background

Corwin's Pattern was created when he used the Jewel of Judgment to draw a new Pattern in an attempt to save Amber from destruction. This new Pattern is connected to Corwin and provides him with unique powers and abilities that set him apart from other Amberites. However, Corwin's Pattern is also more unstable and unpredictable than the original Pattern of Amber, leading to potential complications or challenges in its use.
