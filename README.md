# Savage Amber

An adapation of Roger Zelazny's Chronicles of Amber Setting for Savage Worlds.

## Background

My friends and I wanted to play in the Amber setting, and Amber Diceless just wasn't really an option. Great material, but no one wanted to learn a new system.

But we all liked Savage Worlds. And so, we have these documents.

## What's in here?

This inital version is a series of notes on powers, settings, and artifacts mostly. I'm sure they will need refining. In fact, if you use these and have suggestion, send me a PR. Maybe we can make this awesome.


## Licensing

Look, I have no right to make any money of this. I don't own the rights. (Please, Zelazny estate, don't sue me).

Additionally, I used AI to assist with some of the mechanics. And I have no idea how that falls when we start talking about copyrights.

That being said, I'm releasing this under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Let's see how that goes.
