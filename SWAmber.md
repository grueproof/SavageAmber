# Setting Rules

## Shadow Travel
Traveling through Shadows is a unique aspect of the Amber setting. Characters can traverse different realities and dimensions by shifting their perceptions and altering the world around them.

### Shadow Walking
*Requirements: Arcane Background (Pattern Magic) or Arcane Background (Logrus Magic)*

Characters with the ability to manipulate the Pattern or Logrus can perform a Shadow Walk to travel through Shadows. This process requires a Smarts roll and takes a variable amount of time, depending on the distance between the starting point and the destination, as well as the character's familiarity with the destination. The GM may assign penalties or bonuses to the roll based on the difficulty of the journey.

### Shadow Shifting
*Requirements: Arcane Background (Pattern Magic) or Arcane Background (Logrus Magic)*

Characters with the ability to manipulate the Pattern or Logrus can subtly alter their surroundings to create temporary changes in the local Shadow. This ability requires a Smarts roll and consumes Power Points, depending on the scope and duration of the change. The GM may assign penalties or bonuses to the roll based on the complexity of the desired effect.

## Trump Communication and Travel
*Requirements: Arcane Background (Trump Magic)*

Characters with the Trump Artist Edge can use Trumps to communicate with other individuals or travel to different locations. To initiate a Trump call, the character must make a Smarts roll, with penalties or bonuses applied based on the distance or any interference. Trump travel requires a successful Smarts roll and consumes Power Points.

## Environmental and Planar Effects
The infinite variety of Shadows and realms within the Amber universe can lead to diverse and unique environments. The GM may introduce rules and mechanics for various environmental effects, such as extreme weather conditions, magical phenomena, or planar traits that can impact characters and their abilities.

## Amber and Chaosian Resilience
Characters from Amber and Chaos possess an innate resilience that makes them more resistant to harm than ordinary humans. This can be represented by the following rule:

# Hindrances

1. **Pattern-Blind** (Major Hindrance)

   *Requirements: Chaos heritage*

5. **Pattern/Logrus Backlash** (Major Hindrance)

   The character's connection to the Pattern or Logrus is unstable, causing them to suffer backlash when they overexert their powers. Whenever they fail a roll related to their Pattern or Logrus abilities, they suffer a level of Fatigue.

6. **Fractured Loyalty** (Major Hindrance)
    The character has divided loyalties, torn between their allegiance to Amber and their connections to the Courts of Chaos or another faction. This internal conflict may lead them to question their actions or struggle with moral dilemmas. In situations where their loyalties are in conflict, the character must make a Spirit roll. On a failure, they are unable to take decisive action for a round, becoming Distracted. On a critical failure, they may inadvertently act against their own interests or those of their allies, as determined by the GM.


7. **Haunted by the Serpent** (Major Hindrance)
   The character is haunted by visions and whispers of the Serpent of Chaos, which can be distracting or even dangerous. Whenever the character is under stress or attempting to use their powers, the GM may require a Spirit roll. On a failure, the character becomes Distracted for a round, and on a critical failure, they become Shaken.

8. **Vulnerable to Spikards** (Major Hindrance)
   The character is particularly susceptible to the power of Spikards, magical artifacts that can grant their bearers immense magical abilities. When targeted by a Spikard-wielding enemy, the character suffers a -2 penalty to resist the effects of the Spikard's powers.

9. **Unstable Fractal Sorcery** (Minor Hindrance)
   *Requirements: Arcane Background (Fractal Sorcery)*

10. **Wanted by the Keepers** (Minor Hindrance)
   The Keepers, powerful entities who seek to control or destroy Spikards, are after the character. They may send minions or other agents to pursue the character, and the character may also encounter Keepers as adversaries or obstacles in their adventures.

11. **Ghostwheel Rivalry** (Minor Hindrance)
   *Requirements: Ghostwheel Initiate Edge*
   The character's connection to the Ghostwheel has attracted the attention of a rival or enemy who also seeks to control or manipulate the powerful AI.

# Powers

## Blood Curse (Special)
*Rank: Legendary, Activation Cost: Special, Range: Special, Duration: Permanent*

The Blood Curse is a powerful and dangerous ability possessed by the princes and princesses of Amber. By invoking the curse, a member of the Royal Family can bring devastating misfortune and suffering upon their enemies. The curse's effects can manifest in a variety of ways, such as accidents, illnesses, betrayals, or other forms of hardship, and the exact nature of the curse is often tailored to the target and the circumstances.

Using the Blood Curse requires the caster to make a significant blood sacrifice, usually by receiving or inflicting a severe or potentially fatal wound upon themselves. The severity of the sacrifice determines the potency and range of the curse. The curse's effects are permanent, and they can only be lifted or mitigated through extraordinary means, such as powerful counter-curses or divine intervention.

Due to the dangerous nature of the Blood Curse, it is typically only used as a last resort or in situations of extreme desperation. Invoking the curse carries the risk of drawing the ire of the other members of the Royal Family, who may view it as a reckless and irresponsible use of power.

**Activation Cost:** The activation cost for the Blood Curse is determined by the severity of the blood sacrifice made by the caster. This can range from multiple levels of Fatigue, to Wounds, or even the potential for permanent injury or death. The exact cost should be determined by the GM based on the specific circumstances and desired effects of the curse.

**Range:** The range of the Blood Curse is not limited by physical distance, and it can affect targets anywhere within the multiverse of Shadows. However, the caster must have a clear understanding of the target's identity and a strong emotional connection (usually hatred or intense resentment) to successfully direct the curse.

**Duration:** The Blood Curse's effects are permanent unless lifted or mitigated through extraordinary means. The curse can continue to affect the target for the rest of their life, causing a wide range of misfortunes and hardships.

**Modifiers:** The Blood Curse's potency can be modified based on the severity of the blood sacrifice, the caster's knowledge of and emotional connection to the target, and any relevant Edges, Hindrances, or situational factors that may impact the curse's effectiveness.

**Resisting the Blood Curse:** Resisting the Blood Curse is exceptionally difficult, and it typically requires powerful counter-curses, divine intervention, or other extraordinary means to nullify or mitigate its effects. The exact method of resistance should be determined by the GM based on the specific circumstances and the narrative of the campaign.

**Note:** The Blood Curse is an extremely potent and dangerous ability that should be used sparingly in a campaign. Traditionally, each royal family member only gets one, but this has never been put to the test. (FOr instance, Eric died when he gave his, but Corwin cursed Eric while under great pain but lived. The 'Death Curse of a Prince of Amber' may not be single use. It is up to the GM.)
